            <H1> A Short intro to Our Project</H1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is our college that includes a number of departments, Professors, Students, 
                management staff, and other non-teaching staffs working in our college. Students get all kinds of 
                exposure and knowledge coming to our college. The exam is one part of their life in college which they 
                take up to improvise themselves.<br><br> Generally, Exam cell activity includes manual effort and paper work
                which are tedious. The aim of this project is to design and develop a database to maintain the records of 
                exams that the students take up effectively. It also maintains records of the students' primary details such 
                as name, roll no., etc., it also maintains their marks, CGPA and details of students with arrears and the
                admin will be given the full access to system.<br><br>In our college, there are many departments like CSE, CSE-AI, CSE-Cyber-Security, Civil, Mechanical,
                Aerospace, CCE, ECE etc... There is an Exam Cell where students can come and enroll themselves into the 
                system by registering their names and by sharing their details to admin. The administrator can add, delete 
                and update the exam details. After registering in the system, they can download the hall ticket as pdf which 
                will be generated by the admin and sent to their e-mail accounts.<br><br> Students can also add, delete and update
                their personal details. Once the result is published by the teachers, the admin will add the mark details into 
                the system. Admin is also responsible for generating mark sheets for every registered student. Students can
                also log into the exam cell and check their marks</p>
